### WHat to write about later
- enums in the database are done using varrach + check - this is because the driver does not work with enum Types saved in string form

### Small TODO
- Change log in, so it uses a keycloak page redirect, not a backend request
- add ci/cd pipeline to github actions (https://github.blog/2022-02-02-build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/)
- For date and datetime fields, save timezone information (or use instant and add timezone in front)
- (Think about) Change entities to use a long as IDs
