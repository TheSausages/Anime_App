Rewrite of my Bachelor's Degree Application

### Small TODO
- Change log in, so it uses a keycloak page redirect, not a backend request
- add ci/cd pipeline to github actions (https://github.blog/2022-02-02-build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/)
- For date and datetime fields, save timezone information (or use instant and add timezone in front)
